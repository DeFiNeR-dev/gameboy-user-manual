# Using Game Link Cable

Game Boy games that support a two-player mode can be played using the Game Boy Universal Game Link Cable Set. This set includes a cable to connect the Game Boy Color to other Game Boy Color, Game Boy Pocket or Game Boy Printer, and an adapter to connect to the original Game Boy. (See the illustrations below.)

1. Make sure that the power of the Game Boy Color is **turned off** before you begin.
2. Plug the Game Link cable into the hole on the left side of the Game Boy Color. The hole is called the External Extension Connect (EXT). Make sure **the plug is fully inserted into the hole**.
3. For more information, see the Game Pak instruction booklet.

Some of the two-player games may not work properly due to differences between the Game Boy Color and other Game Boy devices. Only connect the cable when you are playing two-player mode.
